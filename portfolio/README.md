Hello.
 
I am a Website Design Specialist student at Vanier College with a passion for web 
and graphic design. I am currently looking for an internship.

While my program is funded by Emploi Québec, allowing your company to benefit 
from a program of wage subsidies, I am particularly interested in gaining experience
in Web Design. I am also open to opportunities in related fields like UI/UX or Graphic Design.

In addition to my current studies, I have a Bachelor’s degree in Social Communication, 
Advertising and Publicity, and I have experience in different fields of the graphic design 
industry like Journalism graphic design, Endomarketing design, PowerPoint presentation design, 
Packaging design and Educational Marketing design. 

Throughout my career, colleagues have noticed my open-mindedness, communication skills, 
creativity, good humor, sense of organization, responsibility, and dedication for my work.

I am eager to learn more about an internship opportunity and discuss how my skills can benefit 
your company. Thank you for your time and consideration.
